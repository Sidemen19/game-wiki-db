# Game Wiki Database
The Game Wiki Database stores information on games and their correlating [Fandom](https://fandom.com/) / [Gamepedia](https://gamepedia.com/) wiki.

## Why?
The [Twitch Wiki-Bot](https://github.com/Markus-Rost/twitch-wikibot) needed a major improvement to its system of choosing which wiki gets configured upon start of every stream. The owner of that bot reached out, and I made this database and the website as a proof of concept :)
